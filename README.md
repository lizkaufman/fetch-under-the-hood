# fetch-under-the-hood
This is the code from the SoC recap session with Ben (4 Jun 2020) where we reviewed the guts of fetch and then rebuilt it out of an XML request to deepen our understanding of what's happening under the hood.

### Code includes:
- Regular fetch with .then
- Async/await fetch
- XML request
- Rebuilding fetch with an XML request and custom Response object
